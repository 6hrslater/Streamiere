# Streamiere

An app that functions as an IMDB clone that takes in the TMDB API and renders information of the latest movies with descriptions, images and trailers. It uses Google authentication for users to sign in and add movies they liked to their own account page as well as a local outdoor movies night events feature that can send an SMS confirmation containing event details.
